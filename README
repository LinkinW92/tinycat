TinyCat is a tiny and simple project. We will complete this project step by step.
Step1: the ping-pong between client and server.
Step2: the ping-pong among servers.
Step3: try to build up a cluster mode, which named tinyCluster. A cluster consist of one or more then one client, and some servers(at least 3 servers).
       In a tinyCluster, we implement the Raft as TinyRaft to achieve HA.
Step4: we write some data to tinyCluster. Only the master can take the write operation, the master receive the command from the client, then broadcast the
       command to followers, if more than half of followers write successfully, then the master reply success to the client.
